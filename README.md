# cifar-10-images-classification-using-cnn
In this repository, I present a robust predictive model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and leverages a carefully designed architecture to achieve remarkable accuracy.

## Key Features:

### CNN Architecture:
The heart of this project lies in the carefully crafted CNN architecture. It consists of multiple Conv2D layers, MaxPooling layers, and Dropout layers, meticulously designed to capture intricate patterns in the CIFAR-10 images.

### Optimization with Adam:
To train the model effectively, I employed the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. This optimizer plays a crucial role in efficiently adjusting the model's weights during training.

### Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling: 
Learning rate scheduling is essential for model convergence. I implemented ReduceLROnPlateau to monitor the validation loss and adapt the learning rate accordingly, ensuring smoother training and improved performance.

### Model Evaluation: 
The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using standard metrics such as categorical cross-entropy loss and accuracy. Training and validation results are visualized through insightful plots.

### Reproducibility: 
The code provided here is well-structured and documented, making it easy for others to understand and reproduce the results. It serves as an excellent starting point for anyone interested in image classification tasks or CNN-based deep learning projects.

### Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Tensorflow, Keras, Sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn)
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the CIFAR-10 predictive model with your own dataset if desired.

### Contributions and Feedback:
Contributions, issues, and feedback are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improving the model or extending its capabilities, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different hyperparameters, or adapt the model for your specific image classification tasks. Happy coding!
